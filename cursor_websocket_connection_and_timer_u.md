I am still facing the same websocket connection and update issues, despite our previous efforts. Clients aren't successfully sharing timers with each other, despite not getting any errors in the logs:

Looking at the logs and the code, I notice a few concerning patterns:

1. The queue size is consistently high (often around 300 messages) which suggests messages are being queued but not necessarily delivered
2. The WebSocket appears to be connected (we see "WebSocket opened successfully") but we're not seeing any message receipts or acknowledgments
3. The ping/pong mechanism might not be working effectively to keep the connection alive

Let me analyze the code and make some improvements to address these issues:

1. First, I'll add better message delivery confirmation and error handling:


```java
// ... existing code ...
            @Override
            public void onMessage(@NonNull WebSocket webSocket, @NonNull String text) {
                Log.i(TAG, "Received message: " + text);

                try {
                    JSONObject jsonData = new JSONObject(text);
                    String type = jsonData.getString("type");
                    Log.i(TAG, "Message type: " + type);
                    
                    // Send acknowledgment for received messages
                    try {
                        JSONObject ackMessage = new JSONObject()
                            .put("action", "acknowledge")
                            .put("messageId", jsonData.optString("messageId", ""));
                        webSocket.send(ackMessage.toString());
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        Log.e(TAG, "Failed to send acknowledgment", e);
                    }

                    switch (type) {
// ... existing code ...

    private void sendMessage(String message) {
        if (message == null) {
            Log.e(TAG, "Cannot send null message");
            return;
        }

        if (webSocket == null) {
            Log.e(TAG, "WebSocket is null");
            messageListener.onFailure("WebSocket is null");
            return;
        }

        if (!webSocket.send(message)) {
            Log.e(TAG, "Failed to send message");
            messageListener.onFailure("Failed to send message");
            // Attempt to reconnect if message fails to send
            if (currentState == ConnectionState.CONNECTED) {
                setConnectionState(ConnectionState.RECONNECTING);
                attemptReconnect();
            }
        } else {
            Log.i(TAG, "Message sent successfully (queue size: " + webSocket.queueSize() + ")");
            // If queue size is too large, consider reconnecting
            if (webSocket.queueSize() > 100) {
                Log.w(TAG, "Message queue size is too large, forcing reconnection");
                setConnectionState(ConnectionState.RECONNECTING);
                attemptReconnect();
            }
        }
    }
// ... existing code ...
```

2. Now, let's improve the ping/pong mechanism and add better connection state management:


```java
// ... existing code ...
    private static final long PING_INTERVAL_MS = 15000; // Send ping every 15 seconds
    private static final long PONG_TIMEOUT_MS = 5000; // Wait 5 seconds for pong response
    private long lastPongTime = 0;
    private Handler pongTimeoutHandler;
    private Runnable pongTimeoutRunnable;

    public WebsocketManager(
            WebsocketMessageListener messageListener,
            ActiveTimerRepository activeTimerRepository
    ) {
        this.okHttpClient = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
                .retryOnConnectionFailure(true)
                .build();
        this.messageListener = messageListener;
        this.webSocket = null;
        this.activeTimerRepository = activeTimerRepository;
        this.pingHandler = new Handler();
        this.pongTimeoutHandler = new Handler();
        
        this.pingRunnable = new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                if (currentState == ConnectionState.CONNECTED && webSocket != null) {
                    try {
                        JSONObject pingMessage = new JSONObject()
                                .put("action", "ping")
                                .put("timestamp", System.currentTimeMillis());
                        webSocket.send(pingMessage.toString());
                        
                        // Start pong timeout
                        pongTimeoutHandler.postDelayed(pongTimeoutRunnable, PONG_TIMEOUT_MS);
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        Log.e(TAG, "Failed to send ping", e);
                        setConnectionState(ConnectionState.RECONNECTING);
                        attemptReconnect();
                    }
                }
                pingHandler.postDelayed(this, PING_INTERVAL_MS);
            }
        };

        this.pongTimeoutRunnable = new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                if (currentState == ConnectionState.CONNECTED) {
                    long timeSinceLastPong = System.currentTimeMillis() - lastPongTime;
                    if (timeSinceLastPong > PONG_TIMEOUT_MS) {
                        Log.w(TAG, "Pong timeout - no response received");
                        setConnectionState(ConnectionState.RECONNECTING);
                        attemptReconnect();
                    }
                }
            }
        };
    }

    @Override
    public void onMessage(@NonNull WebSocket webSocket, @NonNull String text) {
        Log.i(TAG, "Received message: " + text);

        try {
            JSONObject jsonData = new JSONObject(text);
            String type = jsonData.getString("type");
            
            // Handle pong messages
            if (type.equals("pong")) {
                lastPongTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
                pongTimeoutHandler.removeCallbacks(pongTimeoutRunnable);
                return;
            }
            
            // Rest of the message handling...
// ... existing code ...
```

These changes implement several improvements:

1. **Message Acknowledgment**: Added acknowledgment messages for received messages to ensure reliable delivery.

2. **Queue Management**: Added logic to detect and handle large message queues by forcing reconnection when the queue size exceeds 100 messages.

3. **Improved Ping/Pong Mechanism**:
   - Reduced ping interval from 30s to 15s for more frequent connection checks
   - Added timestamp to ping messages
   - Implemented pong timeout detection (5s)
   - Added automatic reconnection if pong response is not received

4. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Added automatic reconnection attempts when message sending fails
   - Added more detailed logging for connection state changes
   - Improved handling of WebSocket failures

The high queue size in your logs (often around 300 messages) suggests that messages are being queued but not delivered. The new changes should help by:

1. Detecting when the queue gets too large and forcing a reconnection
2. More aggressively checking connection health with more frequent pings
3. Ensuring messages are properly acknowledged
4. Automatically reconnecting when issues are detected

To test these changes:

1. Monitor the logs for any "Pong timeout" or "Message queue size is too large" warnings
2. Check if the queue size remains lower than before
3. Verify that timer updates are being received by other clients
4. Watch for any "Failed to send message" errors

If you're still experiencing issues after these changes, we should:

1. Add more detailed logging around message delivery and acknowledgments
2. Consider implementing a message retry mechanism
3. Look into the server-side WebSocket implementation to ensure it's properly handling the pings and acknowledgments

Would you like me to implement any of these additional improvements?

Thank you for these changes, will test shortly - question: for the ping/pong mechanism, do we rely on the server handling these messages in a certain way? I don't think I made any changes to the backend to respond to pings.

---

**Cursor**

Ah, that's a crucial point! Yes, for the ping/pong mechanism to work properly, the server needs to be configured to:

1. Recognize the ping messages we're sending (with `action: "ping"`)
2. Respond with a pong message (with `type: "pong"`)

Since you haven't made any changes to the backend, the ping messages we're sending will likely be ignored, and we won't receive any pong responses. This means our pong timeout mechanism will constantly trigger reconnections, which could actually make the situation worse.

Let me modify the code to use OkHttp's built-in ping/pong mechanism instead, which is more reliable and doesn't require server-side changes:


```java
// ... existing code ...
    private static final int MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Never stop trying to reconnect
    private static final long RECONNECT_DELAY_MS = 5000; // 5 seconds
    private static final long PING_INTERVAL_MS = 15000; // Send ping every 15 seconds

    private final OkHttpClient okHttpClient;
    private final WebsocketMessageListener messageListener;
    private WebSocket webSocket;
    private final AtomicBoolean isConnecting = new AtomicBoolean(false);
    private final AtomicInteger reconnectAttempts = new AtomicInteger(0);
    private String authToken;
    private String deviceId;
    private final ActiveTimerRepository activeTimerRepository;
    private Handler pingHandler;
    private Runnable pingRunnable;

    public WebsocketManager(
            WebsocketMessageListener messageListener,
            ActiveTimerRepository activeTimerRepository
    ) {
        this.okHttpClient = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
                .retryOnConnectionFailure(true)
                .pingInterval(PING_INTERVAL_MS, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
                .build();
        this.messageListener = messageListener;
        this.webSocket = null;
        this.activeTimerRepository = activeTimerRepository;
    }

    private void setConnectionState(ConnectionState newState) {
// ... existing code ...
```

This change:

1. Removes our custom ping/pong implementation
2. Uses OkHttp's built-in WebSocket ping/pong mechanism by setting `pingInterval` on the OkHttpClient
3. Removes the now-unnecessary ping/pong related fields and handlers

OkHttp's built-in ping/pong mechanism:
- Uses the standard WebSocket protocol ping/pong frames
- Is handled automatically by the WebSocket protocol
- Doesn't require any server-side changes
- Is more efficient as it uses binary frames instead of text messages
- Will automatically detect connection issues and trigger the `onFailure` callback

This should be more reliable than our custom implementation since it:
1. Uses the standard WebSocket protocol features
2. Doesn't depend on server-side message handling
3. Is more efficient
4. Is well-tested in production environments

The rest of our changes (message acknowledgments, queue size monitoring, etc.) are still valid and should help with the connection issues. Would you like me to make any other adjustments to the code?

Ah, I see the issue. The logs show that we're still getting pong timeout errors, which means our previous changes to use OkHttp's built-in ping/pong mechanism didn't fully take effect. Looking at the code, we still have the old pong timeout mechanism in place while also trying to use OkHttp's built-in ping.

Let me clean this up and make it more robust:


```java
// ... existing code ...
    private static final int MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Never stop trying to reconnect
    private static final long RECONNECT_DELAY_MS = 5000; // 5 seconds
    private static final long PING_INTERVAL_MS = 15000; // Send ping every 15 seconds

    private final OkHttpClient okHttpClient;
    private final WebsocketMessageListener messageListener;
    private WebSocket webSocket;
    private final AtomicBoolean isConnecting = new AtomicBoolean(false);
    private final AtomicInteger reconnectAttempts = new AtomicInteger(0);
    private String authToken;
    private String deviceId;
    private final ActiveTimerRepository activeTimerRepository;

    public WebsocketManager(
            WebsocketMessageListener messageListener,
            ActiveTimerRepository activeTimerRepository
    ) {
        this.okHttpClient = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
                .retryOnConnectionFailure(true)
                .pingInterval(PING_INTERVAL_MS, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
                .build();
        this.messageListener = messageListener;
        this.webSocket = null;
        this.activeTimerRepository = activeTimerRepository;
    }

    @Override
    public void onMessage(@NonNull WebSocket webSocket, @NonNull String text) {
        Log.i(TAG, "Received message: " + text);

        try {
            JSONObject jsonData = new JSONObject(text);
            String type = jsonData.getString("type");
            Log.i(TAG, "Message type: " + type);
            
            // Send acknowledgment for received messages
            try {
                JSONObject ackMessage = new JSONObject()
                    .put("action", "acknowledge")
                    .put("messageId", jsonData.optString("messageId", ""));
                webSocket.send(ackMessage.toString());
            } catch (Exception e) {
                Log.e(TAG, "Failed to send acknowledgment", e);
            }

            switch (type) {
// ... existing code ...

    public void close() {
        Log.i(TAG, "Closing WebSocket");
        if (webSocket != null) {
            final int normalClosure = 1000;
            webSocket.close(normalClosure, "AppClosed");
            webSocket = null;
        }
        setConnectionState(ConnectionState.DISCONNECTED);
    }
// ... existing code ...
```

I've made the following changes:

1. Removed all custom ping/pong related code (handlers, runnables, timeouts)
2. Kept only OkHttp's built-in ping mechanism with `.pingInterval(PING_INTERVAL_MS, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)`
3. Simplified the message handling code
4. Removed unnecessary cleanup code in the `close()` method

This should resolve the pong timeout errors you're seeing because:
1. We're no longer using our custom ping/pong mechanism that was causing the timeouts
2. We're relying solely on OkHttp's built-in WebSocket ping/pong frames
3. OkHttp will handle connection health checks automatically

The connection should now be more stable because:
1. OkHttp's ping/pong mechanism is more reliable and uses standard WebSocket protocol frames
2. We've removed the conflicting custom ping/pong implementation
3. The connection health checks are handled at a lower level by OkHttp

You should no longer see the "Pong timeout" errors in the logs. Instead, if there are connection issues, OkHttp will handle them through its built-in mechanisms and trigger the `onFailure` callback, which will then trigger our reconnection logic.

Would you like me to make any other adjustments to improve the connection stability?

Great, I'm getting some connection, but it's still inconsistent, and it looks like we're constantly reconnecting from the logs - is the queue size actually an indication that we're not connected?

Looking at the logs, I see a pattern that suggests our queue size check might be too aggressive and potentially misleading. The queue size of 327 appears consistently right before we force a reconnection, which suggests this might be a default or maximum queue size rather than an actual indication of messages not being sent.

Let's modify our approach to be more reliable:


```java
// ... existing code ...
    private static final int MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Never stop trying to reconnect
    private static final long RECONNECT_DELAY_MS = 5000; // 5 seconds
    private static final long PING_INTERVAL_MS = 15000; // Send ping every 15 seconds
    private static final int MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 1000; // Increased from 100 to handle bursts of messages
    private static final long QUEUE_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS = 5000; // Check queue every 5 seconds

    private final OkHttpClient okHttpClient;
    private final WebsocketMessageListener messageListener;
    private WebSocket webSocket;
    private final AtomicBoolean isConnecting = new AtomicBoolean(false);
    private final AtomicInteger reconnectAttempts = new AtomicInteger(0);
    private String authToken;
    private String deviceId;
    private final ActiveTimerRepository activeTimerRepository;
    private Handler queueCheckHandler;
    private Runnable queueCheckRunnable;
    private long lastSuccessfulMessageTime = 0;

    public WebsocketManager(
            WebsocketMessageListener messageListener,
            ActiveTimerRepository activeTimerRepository
    ) {
        this.okHttpClient = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
                .retryOnConnectionFailure(true)
                .pingInterval(PING_INTERVAL_MS, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
                .build();
        this.messageListener = messageListener;
        this.webSocket = null;
        this.activeTimerRepository = activeTimerRepository;
        
        // Initialize queue check handler
        this.queueCheckHandler = new Handler();
        this.queueCheckRunnable = new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                if (currentState == ConnectionState.CONNECTED && webSocket != null) {
                    int queueSize = webSocket.queueSize();
                    long timeSinceLastMessage = System.currentTimeMillis() - lastSuccessfulMessageTime;
                    
                    // Only force reconnect if queue is large AND we haven't had a successful message in a while
                    if (queueSize > MAX_QUEUE_SIZE && timeSinceLastMessage > QUEUE_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS) {
                        Log.w(TAG, "Queue size " + queueSize + " is too large and no recent successful messages, forcing reconnection");
                        setConnectionState(ConnectionState.RECONNECTING);
                        attemptReconnect();
                    }
                }
                queueCheckHandler.postDelayed(this, QUEUE_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS);
            }
        };
    }

    private void setConnectionState(ConnectionState newState) {
        if (currentState != newState) {
            currentState = newState;
            messageListener.onConnectionStateChanged(newState);
            Log.i(TAG, "Connection state changed to: " + newState);
            
            // Start queue checking when connected
            if (newState == ConnectionState.CONNECTED) {
                queueCheckHandler.post(queueCheckRunnable);
            } else {
                queueCheckHandler.removeCallbacks(queueCheckRunnable);
            }
        }
    }

    private void sendMessage(String message) {
        if (message == null) {
            Log.e(TAG, "Cannot send null message");
            return;
        }

        if (webSocket == null) {
            Log.e(TAG, "WebSocket is null");
            messageListener.onFailure("WebSocket is null");
            return;
        }

        if (!webSocket.send(message)) {
            Log.e(TAG, "Failed to send message");
            messageListener.onFailure("Failed to send message");
            // Attempt to reconnect if message fails to send
            if (currentState == ConnectionState.CONNECTED) {
                setConnectionState(ConnectionState.RECONNECTING);
                attemptReconnect();
            }
        } else {
            lastSuccessfulMessageTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
            Log.i(TAG, "Message sent successfully (queue size: " + webSocket.queueSize() + ")");
        }
    }

    public void close() {
        Log.i(TAG, "Closing WebSocket");
        if (webSocket != null) {
            final int normalClosure = 1000;
            webSocket.close(normalClosure, "AppClosed");
            webSocket = null;
        }
        queueCheckHandler.removeCallbacks(queueCheckRunnable);
        setConnectionState(ConnectionState.DISCONNECTED);
    }
// ... existing code ...
```

I've made several important changes to improve the connection stability:

1. **Smarter Queue Management**:
   - Increased `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE` to 1000 (from 100) to handle bursts of messages
   - Added a time-based check to only force reconnection if we haven't had successful messages in a while
   - Added periodic queue checking instead of checking on every message

2. **Message Success Tracking**:
   - Added `lastSuccessfulMessageTime` to track when messages are actually sent
   - Only force reconnection if both queue is large AND no recent successful messages

3. **Better State Management**:
   - Queue checking starts when connection is established
   - Queue checking stops when connection is lost
   - Proper cleanup in the `close()` method

The key improvements are:

1. We no longer force reconnection just because the queue size is large
2. We only force reconnection if:
   - Queue size is > 1000 AND
   - No successful messages in the last 5 seconds
3. We track successful message delivery to better understand connection health

This should make the connection more stable because:
1. We're not overreacting to temporary queue size increases
2. We have a better understanding of actual message delivery
3. We're using time-based checks to avoid rapid reconnection cycles

The logs should now show fewer reconnections, and the connection should be more stable. Let me know if you'd like me to make any adjustments to these thresholds or add any additional monitoring.

Okay, now it's just connecting once which is great, but now the actual connection seems to be absent - I'm not seeing shared timers in either client I'm testing with.

Would it help for me to make a backend change to enable the ping/pong mechanism we had before?

Yes, it would be helpful to have the server handle ping/pong messages. The current situation suggests that while we're maintaining a connection, the messages might not be flowing properly between clients. Let's modify our approach to use a more explicit ping/pong mechanism that the server can handle:

    private static final long PONG_TIMEOUT_MS = 5000; // Wait 5 seconds for pong response
    private static final int MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 1000; // Increased from 100 to handle bursts of messages

    public void close() {

        if (webSocket != null) {
            final int normalClosure = 1000;
            webSocket.close(normalClosure, "AppClosed");
            webSocket = null;

        pingHandler.removeCallbacks(pingRunnable);
        setConnectionState(ConnectionState.DISCONNECTED);
    }
// ... existing code ...
```

I've made several important changes:

1. Removed OkHttp's built-in ping mechanism and implemented our own explicit ping/pong system
2. Changed message types to be consistent:
   - `type: "ping"` for ping messages
   - `type: "pong"` for pong responses
   - `type: "acknowledge"` for message acknowledgments
3. Added better logging for ping/pong messages
4. Added pong timeout detection

For the server side, you'll need to handle these message types:
1. When receiving a `type: "ping"` message, respond with a `type: "pong"` message
2. When receiving a `type: "acknowledge"` message, you can log it but no response is needed
3. For regular timer messages, you can add a `messageId` field that clients will acknowledge

The server-side changes would look something like this (pseudocode):
```javascript
// When receiving a message
if (message.type === 'ping') {
    // Send pong response
    sendToClient({
        type: 'pong',
        timestamp: message.timestamp
    });
} else if (message.type === 'acknowledge') {
    // Log acknowledgment
    console.log(`Message ${message.messageId} acknowledged`);
} else {
    // Handle regular timer messages
    // Add messageId to the message before broadcasting
    const messageWithId = {
        ...message,
        messageId: generateUniqueId()
    };
    broadcastToClients(messageWithId);
}
```

This explicit ping/pong mechanism should:
1. Keep the connection alive
2. Help detect when the connection is actually dead
3. Ensure messages are being delivered
4. Provide better visibility into the connection state

Would you like me to help with the server-side changes as well?

```javascript
// When receiving a message
if (message.type === 'ping') {
    // Send pong response
    sendToClient({
        type: 'pong',
        timestamp: message.timestamp
    });
} else if (message.type === 'acknowledge') {
    // Log acknowledgment
    console.log(`Message ${message.messageId} acknowledged`);
} else {
    // Handle regular timer messages
    // Add messageId to the message before broadcasting
    const messageWithId = {
        ...message,
        messageId: generateUniqueId()
    };
    broadcastToClients(messageWithId);
}
```
