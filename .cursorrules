# Cursor Rules for Bubble Timer Project

## Deployment Safety Rule
- NEVER run deployment commands (cdk deploy, npm run deploy, etc.)
- NEVER execute commands that could modify production infrastructure
- If infrastructure changes are needed, only suggest them or create the files, but don't deploy
- Always ask for explicit permission before any deployment-related actions

## General Development Rules
- Focus on code analysis, debugging, and file modifications
- Provide clear explanations of issues and solutions
- Test code changes locally when possible
- Document changes and reasoning

## Task Management System
- Use the `tasks/` directory for tracking major work and implementation plans
- Create implementation plans in `tasks/active/` when explicitly requested by the user
- Create summary files in `tasks/done/` for major changes that affect 50%+ of the codebase or fundamental architectural approaches
- Use `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` as a starting point for new tasks
- Do NOT create task files for every chat - only for significant work or when explicitly requested
- When completing major work, create a summary file in `tasks/done/` documenting the changes, decisions, and outcomes
