# Architecture Context

- ALWAYS read @docs/ARCHITECTURE.md first for data flows and component responsibilities
- Reference @docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md for debugging commands and common patterns
- Check @docs/FEATURE_EXTENSION_PATTERNS.md for guidance on extending core systems
- Use the documentation to understand WebSocket, overlay, and sharing patterns before making changes
- Key architecture points: ViewModel â†’ ForegroundService broadcast, Repository observers, #~# delimiters, currentUserId in overlays
- Watch @docs/demo-video.mov for visual understanding of user flows and expected behaviors. If you can't access the demo, view the screenshots in @docs/screenshots to get a sense of the UX.
