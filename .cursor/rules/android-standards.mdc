- Maintain consistent code formatting and naming conventions
- Write clear, self-documenting code with appropriate comments
- Ensure proper resource management and lifecycle handling
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests continue to pass after changes
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Focus on testing critical user flows and edge cases
- Use Android testing frameworks appropriately (JUnit, Espresso, etc.)
