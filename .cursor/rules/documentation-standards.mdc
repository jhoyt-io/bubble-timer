# Documentation Standards

When working with documentation files:
- Keep architecture documentation up to date
- Document any new patterns or architectural decisions
- Maintain clear API documentation for public interfaces
- Update README files when adding new features or changing setup requirements
- Use clear, concise language in documentation
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Keep documentation synchronized with code changes
