# WebSocket Refactoring and Lessons Learned

## Task Summary
**Date**: August 2025  
**Objective**: Refactor backend architecture while preserving WebSocket functionality  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

## Background
The backend was refactored to improve error handling, validation, monitoring, and configuration management. However, during the refactoring, several critical WebSocket functionality issues were introduced that required investigation and fixes.

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Message Format Mismatches
**Problem**: The refactored code didn't properly handle different message formats from the mobile app.

**Root Cause**: 
- `stopTimer` messages: Mobile app sends `timerId` directly
- `updateTimer` messages: Mobile app sends `timer` object with nested fields

**Solution**: Implemented conditional field mapping:
```typescript
const timerId = data.type === 'stopTimer' ? data.timerId : (data.timerId || data.timer?.id);
```

### 2. Over-Engineered Error Handling
**Problem**: Attempted to implement complex error type detection for connection cleanup.

**Root Cause**: The original implementation was simpler and more effective - it cleaned up connections on any error.

**Solution**: Reverted to the original simple approach:
```typescript
} catch (error) {
    await updateConnection({
        userId: cognitoUserName,
        deviceId: connection.deviceId,
        connectionId: undefined,
    });
}
```

### 3. Breaking Broadcasting Patterns
**Problem**: Changed the fire-and-forget broadcasting pattern for shared users.

**Root Cause**: The original implementation used non-awaited `Promise.allSettled()` for performance.

**Solution**: Restored fire-and-forget pattern:
```typescript
currentSharedUsers.forEach((userName: string) => {
    sendDataToUser(userName, senderDeviceId, data).catch((error) => {
        // Handle error but don't await
    });
});
```

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Preserve Working Interfaces
- **NEVER change message formats** without coordinating with frontend
- **Compare with original implementations** before refactoring
- **Maintain backward compatibility** during architectural changes

### 2. Simple is Better
- **Don't over-engineer error handling** - the original simple approach was correct
- **Avoid complex error type detection** when simple cleanup works
- **Preserve working patterns** even if they seem "suboptimal"

### 3. Understand the Full Context
- **Check git history** before making changes to understand the original working implementation
- **Test user flows** end-to-end, not just unit tests
- **Monitor production logs** to catch issues early

### 4. Incremental Changes
- **Make small, testable changes** rather than large rewrites
- **Test each change** before proceeding
- **Document decisions** explaining why certain patterns are used

## Technical Patterns Established

### WebSocket Message Handling
```typescript
// CORRECT: Handle different message formats appropriately
const timerId = data.type === 'stopTimer' ? data.timerId : (data.timerId || data.timer?.id);
```

### Broadcasting Pattern
```typescript
// CORRECT: Send to user's connections first, then shared users
await sendDataToUser(userId, deviceId, messageWithId);
await handleTimerSharing(data, deviceId, timerLogger);
```

### Connection Cleanup
```typescript
// CORRECT: Simple cleanup on any error
} catch (error) {
    await updateConnection({
        userId: cognitoUserName,
        deviceId: connection.deviceId,
        connectionId: undefined,
    });
}
```

## Documentation Created

### New Documentation Structure
- `docs/README.md` - Overview and quick start
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design and data flows
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Development workflow and patterns
- `docs/WEBSOCKET.md` - WebSocket implementation details

### Updated .cursorrules
- Simplified and organized like Android repo
- Focused on key principles and safety rules
- References to detailed documentation

## Testing and Validation

### Pre-Deployment Testing
- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ CDK synthesizes successfully
- ✅ WebSocket message formats validated
- ✅ Broadcasting patterns tested

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
- ✅ CloudWatch logs monitored for errors
- ✅ User flows tested for timer sharing
- ✅ Performance metrics tracked

## Success Criteria Met

- [x] WebSocket functionality restored to working state
- [x] Timer sharing works across users
- [x] Stop timer messages propagate correctly
- [x] Update timer messages propagate correctly
- [x] Connection cleanup works properly
- [x] Documentation updated and organized
- [x] Lessons learned codified in .cursorrules

## Future Recommendations

### For Similar Refactoring
1. **Create comprehensive test suite** before refactoring
2. **Document current working behavior** in detail
3. **Make incremental changes** with testing at each step
4. **Compare with original implementation** frequently

### For WebSocket Development
1. **Always check message formats** in both frontend and backend
2. **Preserve broadcasting patterns** that work
3. **Keep error handling simple** and effective
4. **Monitor connection health** in production

## Impact
- **Reliability**: WebSocket functionality restored to working state
- **Maintainability**: Better organized code with proper error handling
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for future development
- **Learning**: Valuable lessons about preserving working interfaces

## Files Modified
- `lib/bubble-timer-backend-stack.websocket.ts` - Fixed WebSocket implementation
- `docs/` - Created comprehensive documentation
- `.cursorrules` - Updated with lessons learned
- `tasks/` - Created task management structure

## Notes
This refactoring highlighted the importance of understanding existing working patterns before making architectural changes. The key insight was that the original implementation, while appearing simple, was actually well-designed and effective. The lesson is to preserve working behavior and make minimal, focused changes rather than over-engineering solutions.
