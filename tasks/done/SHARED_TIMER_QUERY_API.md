# Shared Timer Query API Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan implements a query API for shared timers and frontend integration to display and manage shared timer invitations.

## Phase 1: Backend API Enhancement âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Completed Tasks:
- [x] **REST API Endpoint**: `/timers/shared` for querying shared timers
- [x] **Database Schema**: Dedicated `SharedTimers` table with GSI for efficient querying
- [x] **Authentication**: Cognito-based user authentication
- [x] **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS setup for API Gateway
- [x] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- [x] **Testing**: Jest tests for API functionality
- [x] **WebSocket Improvements**: Fixed timer stopping synchronization

### âœ… Key Backend Changes:
- **New REST API**: `GET /timers/shared` returns timers shared with the authenticated user
- **Database Optimization**: Removed inefficient `Scan` operations in favor of `Query` with GSI
- **Shared Timer Relationships**: Proper management of shared timer relationships
- **WebSocket Logic**: Now uses actual shared relationships instead of `shareWith` list
- **Timer Deletion**: Properly removes shared relationships before deleting timers

## Phase 2: Frontend Implementation âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Completed Tasks:
- [x] **Database Schema**: Added `SharedTimer` entity and DAO
- [x] **Repository Layer**: `SharedTimerRepository` with API integration
- [x] **ViewModel**: `SharedTimerViewModel` with proper state management
- [x] **UI Components**: `SharedTimerListFragment` and adapter
- [x] **Navigation**: Integrated into main app navigation
- [x] **Accept/Reject Logic**: Complete acceptance flow with WebSocket connection
- [x] **Timer State Management**: Proper handling of paused/unpaused timers
- [x] **Testing**: Comprehensive tests for shared timer acceptance

### âœ… Key Frontend Changes:
- **New UI Tab**: "SHARED" tab in main navigation
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: SwipeRefreshLayout for manual refresh
- **Accept/Reject Buttons**: Complete acceptance flow
- **WebSocket Integration**: Automatic WebSocket connection for accepted timers
- **Timer State Preservation**: Correct handling of timer state (paused/unpaused)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of null values and network errors

## Phase 3: UI Components âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Completed Tasks:
- [x] **Shared Timer List**: RecyclerView with custom adapter
- [x] **Accept/Reject Actions**: Button handlers with proper state updates
- [x] **Empty State**: TextView for when no shared timers exist
- [x] **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators
- [x] **Error Display**: User-friendly error messages
- [x] **Navigation Integration**: Seamless integration with existing navigation

## Phase 4: Integration and Testing âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Completed Tasks:
- [x] **End-to-End Testing**: Complete flow from sharing to acceptance
- [x] **WebSocket Synchronization**: Timer updates and stops sync across devices
- [x] **Database Consistency**: Proper handling of shared timer relationships
- [x] **Error Scenarios**: Testing with null values, network failures
- [x] **Performance Testing**: Efficient database queries and UI updates

## âœ… Key Achievements:

### **Shared Timer Acceptance Flow:**
1. User receives shared timer invitation
2. Pull-to-refresh fetches latest invitations
3. User presses "Accept" button
4. Timer is added to active timers with correct state
5. WebSocket connects for real-time updates
6. Timer appears in main timer list

### **WebSocket Improvements:**
1. **Timer Updates**: Sent to all currently shared users (not just `shareWith`)
2. **Timer Stops**: Properly synchronized across all shared devices
3. **Relationship Management**: Automatic cleanup of shared relationships
4. **Database Consistency**: Relationships removed before timer deletion

### **Testing Coverage:**
- âœ… Backend API tests
- âœ… WebSocket handler tests  
- âœ… Frontend ViewModel tests
- âœ… Database integration tests
- âœ… End-to-end acceptance flow tests

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Status: COMPLETE**

The shared timer query API and frontend integration are now fully implemented and tested. Users can:

1. **Share timers** with other users
2. **Receive invitations** in the SHARED tab
3. **Accept invitations** to add timers to their active list
4. **See real-time updates** via WebSocket
5. **Experience synchronized stops** across all shared devices

The implementation is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, testing, and proper state management.
